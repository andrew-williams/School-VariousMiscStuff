GDD HUD AND GUI DESIGN
Discussed about the GUI and HUD design over the past few days with Leon, Ryu, Christian,
Jacky and Michael

GUI may be attached to the character

GUI popped up if needed when required. Maybe dynamic or static.

Changing camera perspectives from exploration to combat, 
close to distance in a 3rd person perspective

The overall design will be simple to reduce displaying unnecessary 
information in order to avoid cluttering up the screen.
